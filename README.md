First video demo is named 'demo1.mp4'

Second video demo is named 'demo2.mp4'

Update 1 includes:
- laboratory mesh (including windows, desks, shelves)
- dissection tools (downloaded from Sketchfab)
- basic shapes to showcase future object placement
- XR origin camera (allowing for free movement, as shown in demo1)

Update 2 includes:
- meshes for frog and organs (including heart, lungs, stomach, pancreas, intestines, colon, spleen and gallbladder)
- thickened bezier curves to simulate connections between organs

- improved lab space (added blackboard, removed useless dissection tools, added notebook for instructions, added tray to display organs)
- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED scripts for 'cutting' (using scalpel) and 'grabbing' (using forceps)
- implemented ability to grab and place organs with 'free hand' (as shown in demo2)
- integration with VR equipment (Meta Quest 3)


Next update will (hopefully) include:
- retopology for current meshes to increase performance
- meshes for all organs
- better textures for frog
- proper implementation for tool interactions
- mesh for 'What's this?'-inator
